Trait:natural attacks
Feat:Alert
<Desc>
Willowy and sinuous, the Cat-Folk are tricksters and pranksters. They are surprisingly strong for their size, but quite short-sighted.  And they find the proverb, "Curiosity killed the cat", highly offensive.

frequently find themselves shunted into martial 
roles, because they excel at such.
